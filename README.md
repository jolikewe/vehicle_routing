# Planck
Project Planck is a research project for applying quantum optimization algorithms to solve the following problems:
1. Vehicle Scheduling Problem
2. Vehicle Routing Problem

The detailed problem statement, constraints and proposed solutions can be found [here](docs/README.md)

## Getting started
If you are unfamiliar with quantum computing, walk through this [example notebook](examples/qiskit_intro.ipynb) for a quick introduction to the fundamentals.

### Quickstart
To run the application, you will need Docker CLI installed. Run the following command to start the application:
```
docker compose up -d
```
